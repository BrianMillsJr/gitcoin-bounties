|Payment Channels    |Payments with Conflux with USDT (or other Stablecoins) for micropayments and settlement scenarios like gaming, tipping, gifts, etc. With a focus on emerging markets, we believe providing a payments solution for local businesses or the unbanked can help propel adoption of cryptocurrencies and with our wide variety of stablecoins offered, developers can reduce the barrier of adoption by offering some of the most liquid and well-recognized stablecoins on the market.                                                                                                                                          |DeFi          |Stablecoins, commerce, micropayments                                       |https://developer.flexa.network/                                                                        |
|DAO                 |Create a DAO framework on Conflux which can be forked into governance for DeFi or a Venture DAO. DAOs allow new DeFi applications to plug in a turn-key system, with Conflux being a public and permionless platform, the launch of several DeFi applications dependant on DAOs for decentralized governance is growing. The DAO can also be used for creating a for-profit system where venture capitalists can pool funds and invest in projects pre-launch to help them launch on Conflux.                                                                                                                                |DeFi          |Governance, Venture Capitalism, Fundraising                                |https://github.com/MolochVentures                                                                       |
|Stablecoins         |Create new stablecoins using crypto-backed or algorithmic-backed mechanisms for new currencies or assets. The stablecoin market is the largest and most prolific token model in all of blockchain, we have recently seen new experiemnts using algorithmic-backed tokens which reduce the barrier of entry for developers to develop new stablecoins, with Conflux being a global-oriented project, we would love to see where you can apply stablecoins next using the latest developments of collateralization.                                                                                                            |DeFi          |Algorithms, Fiat bridging, collateralization                               |https://github.com/ampleforth                                                                           |
|Bridges             |Create bridges with other blockchains to allow for cross-chain asset swapping as well as cross-chain interactions. ShuttleFlow is a protocol released with our blockchain that provides asset wrapping and cross-chain interactions in a secure, and decentralized fashion.

|Mobile Development  |SDKs, Key Management, Wallets, other mobile applications with Conflux.

|Identity Solutions  |Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.
